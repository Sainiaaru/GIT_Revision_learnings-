GIT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS


1) What is GIT?
a1) Git is an open source distributed version control system and source code management (SCM) system with an insistence
 to control small and large projects with speed and efficiency.



2) Which language is used in Git?
a2) Git uses 'C' language. Git is quick, and 'C' language makes this possible by decreasing the overhead of run times
 contained with high-level languages.



3) What is a repository in Git?
a3) A repository consists of a list named .git, where git holds all of its metadata for the catalog. The 
content of the .git file is private to Git.



4) What is 'bare repository' in Git?
a4) A "bare" repository in Git includes the version control information and no working files (no tree), 
and it doesn't include the special. git sub-directory. Instead, it consists of all the contents of the 
.git sub-directory directly in the main directory itself, whereas working list comprises of:
A .git subdirectory with all the Git associated revision history of your repo.
A working tree, or find out copies of your project files.



5) What is the purpose of GIT stash?
a5 )GIT stash takes the present state of the working file and index and puts in on the stack for next and 
gives you back a clean working file. So in case if you are in the middle of object and require to jump over to the 
other task, and at the same time you don't want to lose your current edits, you can use GIT stash.



6) What is GIT stash drop?
a6) When you are done with the stashed element or want to delete it from the directory, 
run the git 'stash drop' command. It will delete the last added stash item by default, and it can also remove a 
specific topic if you include as an argument.



7) What are the advantages of using GIT?
a7) Here are some of the essential advantages of Git:
Data repetition and data replication is possible.It is a much applicable service.For one depository you can have 
only one directory of Git.The network performance and disk application are excellent.It is effortless to collaborate on any project
You can work on any plan within the Git



8) What is the function of 'GIT PUSH' in GIT?
a8 ) 'GIT PUSH' updates remote refs along with related objects



9) Why do we require branching in GIT?
a9) With the help of branching, you can keep your branch, and you can also jump between the different branches. 
You can go to your past work while at the same time keeping your recent work intact.



10) What is the purpose of 'git config'?
a10) The 'Git config' is a great method to configure your choice for the Git installation. 
Using this command, you can describe the repository behavior, preferences, and user information.



11) What is the definition of "Index" or "Staging Area" in GIT?
a 11) When you are making the commits, you can make innovation to it, format it and review it in the common area 
known as 'Staging Area' or 'Index'.



12) What is a 'conflict' in git?
a12 ) A 'conflict' appears when the commit that has to be combined has some change in one place, 
and the current act also has a change at the same place. Git will not be easy to predict which change should take 
precedence.



13) What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
a13) Git pull command pulls innovation or commits from a specific branch from your central repository and updates 
your object branch in your local repository.
Git fetch is also used for the same objective, but it works in a slightly different method. 
When you behave a git fetch, it pulls all new commits from the desired branch and saves it in a new branch 
in your local repository. If you need to reflect these changes in your target branch, git fetch should be followed 
with a git merge. Your target branch will only be restored after combining the target branch and fetched branch. 
To make it simple for you, remember the equation below:

Git pull = git fetch + git merge



14) How to resolve a conflict in Git?
a14) If you need to resolve a conflict in Git, edit the list for fixing the different changes, and then you can run 
"git add" to add the resolved directory, and after that, you can run the 'git commit' for committing the repaired merge.



15) What is the purpose of the git clone?
a15) The git clone command generates a copy of a current Git repository. To get the copy of a central repository, 
'cloning' is the simplest way used by programmers.



16) What is git pull origin?
a16) pull is a get and a consolidation. 'git pull origin master' brings submits from the master branch of the 
source remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it combines origin/master into the branch you 
currently have looked out.



17) What does git commit a?
a17) Git commits "records changes to the storehouse" while git push " updates remote refs along with contained objects"
 So the first one is used in a network with your local repository, while the latter one is used to communicate with a
  remote repository.



18) Why GIT better than Subversion?
a18) GIT is an open source version control framework; it will enable you to run 'adaptations' of a task, 
which demonstrate the changes that were made to the code over time also it allows you keep the backtrack if vital 
and fix those changes. Multiple developers can check out, and transfer changes, and each change can then be attributed
 to a particular developer.



19) Explain what is commit message?
a19) Commit message is a component of git which shows up when you submit a change. Git gives you a content tool 
where you can enter the adjustments made to a commit.

20) Why is it desirable to create an additional commit rather than amending an existing commit?
a20) There are couples of reason
The correct activity will devastate the express that was recently saved in a commit. If only the commit message 
gets changed, that's not a problem. But if the contents are being modified, chances of excluding something 
important remains more. Abusing "git commit- amends" can cause a small commit to increase and acquire inappropriate changes.



21) What does 'hooks' comprise of in Git?
a21) This index comprises of Shell contents which are enacted after running the relating git commands. 
For instance, Git will attempt to execute the post-commit content after you run a commit.




22) What is the distinction between Git and Github?
A) Git is a correction control framework, a tool to deal with your source code history.
GitHub is a hosting function for Git storehouses.
GitHub is a website where you can transfer a duplicate of your Git archive. 
It is a Git repository hosting service, which offers the majority of the distributed update control 
and source code management (SCM) usefulness of Git just as including its features.




23) In Git, how would you return a commit that has just been pushed and made open?
a23) There can be two answers to this question : 
Remove or fix the bad document in another commit and push it to the remote repository. 
This is a unique approach to correct a mistake. Once you have necessary changes to the record, 
commit it to the remote repository for that I will utilize (git submit - m "commit message.")

Make another commit that fixes all changes that were made in the terrible commit. to do this, I will utilize a command
git revert <name of bad commit>




24) What does the committed item contain?
a24) Commit item contains the following parts; you should specify all the three present below:
A set of records, representing to the condition of a task at a given purpose of time, 
References to parent commit objects
An SHAI name, a 40 character string that uniquely distinguishes the commit object.




25) Describing branching systems you have utilized?
a25) Feature Branching:
A component branch model keeps the majority of the changes for a specific element within a branch. 
At the point when the item is throughout tested and approved by automated tests, the branch is then converged 
into master.
Task Branching:
In this model, each assignment is actualized on its branch with the undertaking key included in the branch name. 
It is anything but difficult to see which code actualizes which task, search for the task key in the branch name.
Release Branching:
Once the create branch has procured enough features for a discharge, you can clone that branch to frame a Release branch.
 Making this branch begins the following discharge cycle so that no new features can be included after this point, 
 just bug fixes, documentation age, and other release oriented assignments ought to go in this branch. 
 When it is prepared to deliver, the release gets converged into master and labeled with a form number. 
 



26) By what method will you know in Git if a branch has just been combined into master?
a26) The appropriate response is immediate.
To know whether a branch has been merged into master or not you can utilize the below commands:
git branch - merged - It records the branches that have been merged into the present branch.
git branch - no merged - It records the branches that have not been merged.




27) How might you fix a messed up submit?
a27) To fix any messed up commit, you will utilize the order "git commit correct." By running this direction, 
you can set the wrecked commit message in the editor.



28) Mention the various Git repository hosting functions.
a28) The following are the Git repository hosting functions:
Pikacode
Visual Studio Online
GitHub
GitEnterprise
SourceForge.net



29) Mention some of the best graphical GIT customers for LINUX?
a29) Some of the best GIT customer for LINUX is
Git Cola
Smart git
Git-g
Git GUI
Giggle
qGit



30) What is Subgit? Why use it?
a30) 'Subgit' is a tool that migrates SVN to Git. It is a stable and stress-free migration. 
Subgit is one of the solutions for a company-wide migration from SVN to Git that is:
It is much superior to git-svn
No need to change the infrastructure that is already placed.
It allows using all git and all sub-version features.
It provides stress free migration experience.
